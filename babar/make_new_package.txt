Usually, it's the easist to start off with a package from CVS and modify as you go.  

The EffCounter package started as a module appended to the BToDTauNuSemiLepHadUser package,
and when I was convinced it works as expected, follow

https://www.slac.stanford.edu/BFROOT/www/doc/workbook/newpackage/newpackage.html

to make it your own package.

To` call your package in another package, usually you need to add your module in 3 places.

1) AppUserBuildBase.cc
2) Main control tcl file
3) bin_....mk files (if your package hasn't been added to the CVS)
